# Wings-Installer
A simple script to install wings on a Ubuntu 16.04 instance!

Wings is the daemon for the Pterodactyl Panel, this should be used in conjunction with software supplied by https://Pterodactyl.io

## You can use the one line installer but it requires that you have `curl` installed!

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheFonix/Wings-Installer/master/install.sh | sh
```
